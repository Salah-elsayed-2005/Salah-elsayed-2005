## About Me

- 🎓 Currently pursuing **Computer Engineering** at **EUI**.  
- 🤖 Focused on **AI** and **Backend** development.  
- 💻 Programming in **C, C++, and Python**.  
- 🔭 Working on various university projects (like a **library system** and **loan data analysis**).  

I’m constantly learning new technologies and eager to work on projects that **innovate** and **challenge** the status quo.

## Featured Projects

Even though they may not be “super,” here are a few I’ve dabbled in:

1. **University Library System**  
   An application that simplifies library record management, borrowing, and returns.

2. **Loan Data Analysis**  
   A simple-to-use application to predict loan acceptance, visualised in streamlit and coded in python.

Feel free to explore these (and other) repos in my profile. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration.
